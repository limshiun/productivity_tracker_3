# Performance Optimization Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Slow Video Stream** ✅

- **Problem**: MJPEG streaming was inefficient and caused lag
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced streaming resolution to max 800px width
  - Improved JPEG compression (quality 75 with optimization)
  - Limited streaming to 10 FPS
  - Added frame queue management

### 2. **Poor Tracking Accuracy** ✅

- **Problem**: Detection confidence too low, causing false positives
- **Solution**:
  - Increased person detection confidence: `0.15 → 0.35`
  - Increased phone detection confidence: `0.20 → 0.40`
  - Improved IoU thresholds: `0.50 → 0.45`
  - Better tracking parameters: `min_iou_match: 0.30 → 0.25`

### 3. **Slow Processing** ✅

- **Problem**: Using heavy yolov8m.pt model and processing every frame
- **Solution**:
  - Switched to faster `yolov8s.pt` model
  - Frame skipping: Process every 3rd frame
  - Frame resizing: Resize to 640px width for processing
  - Coordinate scaling back to original resolution

### 4. **UI Lag** ✅

- **Problem**: Too frequent updates and large data transfers
- **Solution**:
  - Rate limiting: Emit data max every 500ms
  - Reduced chart data points: 20 → 15
  - Smaller data history: 1000 → 500 points
  - Disabled chart animations

## Configuration Changes Made

### Model Settings

```yaml
models:
  person:
    weights: "yolov8s.pt" # Changed from yolov8m.pt
    conf: 0.35 # Increased from 0.15
    iou: 0.45 # Reduced from 0.50
  phone:
    weights: "yolov8s.pt" # Changed from yolov8m.pt
    conf: 0.40 # Increased from 0.20
    iou: 0.45 # Reduced from 0.50
```

### Analytics Settings

```yaml
analytics:
  fps_assumed: 10.0 # Reduced from 15.0
  loiter_seconds: 8.0 # Reduced from 10.0
  active_speed_px_per_s: 30.0 # Reduced from 40.0
  phone_overlap_iou: 0.15 # Increased from 0.10
```

### Tracking Settings

```yaml
tracking:
  max_lost_secs: 1.5 # Reduced from 2.0
  min_iou_match: 0.25 # Reduced from 0.30
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Start Optimized Version

```bash
python start_ui.py
```

The startup script now automatically uses the optimized version (`app_optimized.py`).

### 2. Monitor Performance

- Check "Processing FPS" in the UI
- Aim for 8-12 FPS for good performance
- Monitor CPU usage in Task Manager

### 3. Further Optimization (if needed)

#### For Lower-End Hardware:

```yaml
# Use even lighter model
models:
  person:
    weights: "yolov8n.pt" # Nano model - fastest
    conf: 0.40 # Higher confidence
```

#### For Higher Accuracy (if you have powerful hardware):

```yaml
# Use heavier model
models:
  person:
    weights: "yolov8m.pt" # Medium model - more accurate
    conf: 0.30 # Lower confidence for more detections
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Slow Performance?

1. **Check Model File**:

   ```bash
   # Verify you have yolov8s.pt
   ls -la yolov8*.pt
   ```

2. **Reduce Frame Skip**:

   ```python
   # In app_optimized.py, increase FRAME_SKIP
   FRAME_SKIP = 3  # Process every 4th frame instead of every 3rd
   ```

3. **Lower Resolution**:
   ```python
   # In app_optimized.py, reduce TARGET_WIDTH
   TARGET_WIDTH = 480  # Smaller processing resolution
   ```

### Still Inaccurate Tracking?

1. **Adjust ROI Polygon**:

   - Make sure your ROI polygon matches the actual area of interest
   - Use smaller, more focused areas

2. **Tune Confidence Thresholds**:

   ```yaml
   # Increase for fewer false positives
   models:
     person:
       conf: 0.45 # Higher = fewer detections but more accurate
   ```

3. **Check Lighting Conditions**:
   - Ensure good lighting in the monitored area
   - Avoid backlighting and shadows

### Network Issues?

1. **RTSP Stream Quality**:

   - Use lower resolution stream from camera (720p instead of 1080p)
   - Check network bandwidth

2. **Local Network**:
   ```bash
   # Test RTSP stream directly
   ffplay "rtsp://your-camera-url"
   ```

## Advanced Tuning

### Custom Frame Processing

Edit `app_optimized.py` to adjust:

- `FRAME_SKIP`: How many frames to skip (higher = faster, less accurate)
- `TARGET_WIDTH`: Processing resolution (lower = faster, less accurate)
- `EMIT_INTERVAL`: How often to send updates to UI (higher = less responsive)

### Model Selection Guide

- **yolov8n.pt**: Fastest, ~2-3x speed, 80% accuracy
- **yolov8s.pt**: Balanced, good speed, 85% accuracy ⭐ **Recommended**
- **yolov8m.pt**: Slower, best accuracy, 90% accuracy

### Hardware Recommendations

- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, dual-core CPU
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, quad-core CPU
- **Optimal**: 16GB RAM, 6+ core CPU, dedicated GPU
